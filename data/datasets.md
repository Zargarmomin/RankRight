# Datasets & Samples

You can practice / benchmark with public datasets (download manually and place files under `data/`):

- Kaggle **Resume Dataset** (labeled resumes): https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snehaanbhawal/resume-dataset
- Kaggle **Job Title and Job Description Dataset**: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kshitizregmi/jobs-and-job-description
- Kaggle **Job Descriptions Dataset** (521 analyst JDs): https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jayakishan225/job-descriptions-dataset

> Tip: You **do not** need a dataset to run this app. You can start with your own JD and a few sample resumes.
